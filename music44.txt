[00:00.00]Born to Win
[00:06.93]Each human being is born as something new, 
[00:12.63]something that never existed before. 
[00:14.47]Each is born with the capacity to win at life. 
[00:18.32]Each person has a unique way of seeing, 
[00:21.37]hearing, touching, tasting and thinking. 
[00:24.31]Each has his or her own unique potential capabilities and limitations. 
[00:30.11]Each can be a significant, thinking, 
[00:33.08]aware and creative being — 
[00:34.93]a productive person, a winner.
[00:37.89]The word “winner” and “loser” have many meanings. 
[00:42.27]When we refer to a person as a winner, 
[00:45.31]we do not mean one who makes someone else lose. 
[00:48.39]To us, 
[00:49.80]a winner is one who responds authentically by being credible, 
[00:53.42]trustworthy, responsive, and genuine, 
[00:56.03]both as an individual and as a member of a society.
[00:59.96]Winners do not dedicate their lives to a concept 
[01:03.59]of what they imagine they should be; rather, 
[01:05.88]they are themselves 
[01:07.53]and as such do not use their energy putting on a performance, 
[01:11.02]maintaining pretence, and manipulating others. 
[01:15.09]They are aware that there is a difference 
[01:18.03]between being loving and acting loving, 
[01:20.42]between being stupid and acting stupid, 
[01:23.49]between being knowledgeable and acting knowledgeable. 
[01:27.32]Winners do not need to hide behind a mask.
[01:30.92]Winners are not afraid to do their own thinking 
[01:34.88]and to use their own knowledge. 
[01:36.61]They can separate facts from opinion 
[01:39.69]and don’t pretend to have all the answers. 
[01:42.41]They listen to others, evaluate what they say, 
[01:46.23]but come to their own conclusions. 
[01:48.54]Although winners can admire and respect other people, 
[01:53.02]they are not totally defined, 
[01:55.55]demolished, bound, or awed by them.
[01:58.94]Winners do not play “helpless”, 
[02:02.09]nor do they play the blaming game. 
[02:04.52]Instead, they assume responsibility for their own lives. 
[02:08.78]They do not give others a false authority over them. 
[02:12.59]Winners are their own bosses and know it.
[02:16.11]A winner’s timing is right. 
[02:19.50]Winners respond appropriately to the situation. 
[02:22.88]Their responses are related to the message sent 
[02:26.61]and preserve the significance, 
[02:28.56]worth, well-being, and dignity of the people involved. 
[02:32.49]Winners know that for everything 
[02:35.36]there is a season and for every activity a time.
[02:38.41]Although winners can freely enjoy themselves, 
[02:41.92]they can also postpone enjoyment, 
[02:44.86]can discipline themselves in the present 
[02:47.17]to enhance their enjoyment in the future. 
[02:49.46]Winners are not afraid to go after what they want, 
[02:53.72]but they do so in appropriate ways. 
[02:56.47]Winners do not get their security by controlling others. 
[03:00.41]They do not set themselves up to lose.
[03:03.67]A winner cares about the world and its peoples. 
[03:07.63]A winner is not isolated from the general problems of society, 
[03:12.64]but is concerned, compassionate, 
[03:15.38]and committed to improving the quality of life. 
[03:18.02]Even in the face of national and international adversity, 
[03:22.40]a winner’s self-image is not one of a powerless individual. 
[03:26.32]A winner works to make the world a better place.
